# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

One of the first questions I answered with the corresponding SQL: 

1. Which artist has the most tracks in the database?

SELECT artist_name, COUNT(*) AS track_count 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
GROUP BY artist_name 
ORDER BY track_count DESC 
LIMIT 1;

2. Next list all tracks that have a popularity greater than 80.
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
WHERE popularity > 80;

3. Then I found the track with the highest energy.
SELECT track_name, artist_name, energy 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
ORDER BY energy DESC 
LIMIT 1;

4. Finally, I searched the average danceability of tracks by a specific artist (e.g., 'Artist Name')
SELECT AVG(danceability) AS average_danceability 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
WHERE artist_name = 'Artist Name';
